Contains c/c++ code and notes that catalog my progress through the programmers 
reference manual of the Intel 80960mc microprocessor.

It is a RISC processor designed by intel in the 80s which they failed to market.
I find the design fascinating and as such am going through the manuals I have 
found on the internet

The sim directory is my first generation simulator which sucks and doesn't work
well. Take a look at the sim3 project instead.

The hardware directory contains very old hardware implementations as a
reference. I have much newer designs that are not public because they are
modular to save money.
