NAME
	xmalloc() - get memory or bust
INDEX
	xmalloc() uses malloc()

SYNOPSIS
	char *	my_memory;

	my_memory = xmalloc(42); / * my_memory gets address of 42 chars * /

DESCRIPTION

	Use xmalloc() as an "error-free" malloc(). It does almost the same job.
	When it cannot honour your request for memory it BOMBS your program
	with a "virtual memory exceeded" message. Malloc() returns NULL and
	does not bomb your program.

	malloc()
