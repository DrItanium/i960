Scope
=====
This document describes the new version of gdb960 program available with
the beta 2.4 release of mon960.


New Gdb960 Features
===================
PCI communication and PCI download are now available for selected hosts
and hardware.  Supported hosts are:  any DOS-based PC with a PCI bus
and PCI-compliant BIOS.
   
PCI communication/download may be used with any MON960-based target that
includes a PCI interface ported to the monitor's PCI communication
API.  One such target distributed by Intel is the PCI 80960DP, which is
a Cyclone evaluation baseboard with a PLX PCI 9060 PCI bus master
interface chip installed.

Note that the PCI 80960DP target requires a PC host with sufficient
physical space to accept a full-sized PCI card.


New PCI Options
===============

Switch              Semantics

-pci                Selects a target connected to the host's PCI bus.  This
                    option selects the target using an algorithm that
                    searches for the first available PCI 80960DP.

-pcib <bus_no> <dev_no> <func_no>
                    Selects a target connected to the host's PCI bus.  The
                    target PCI device is selected using an absolute PCI bus
                    address.  All arguments are specified in hex.
                    
-pcic {io | mmap}   Configures PCI communications.  By default, gdb960
                    always attempts to communicate with a PCI device via
                    I/O space.  This switch permits the user to
                    explicitly specify the interface.

                       io ->   Communicate via I/O space (i.e., use in/out
                               instructions to access the PCI device).
                       mmap -> Communicate via memory mapped access.
                    
-pciv <vendor_id> <device_id>
                    Selects a target connected to the host's PCI bus.  The
                    target PCI device is selected by specifying a PCI vendor
                    and device ID.  All arguments are specified in hex.
                    This option selects the target using an algorithm that
                    searches for the first available PCI device configured
                    with the requested vendor_id and device_id.

If your PC host and target meet the requirements listed above, you will
probably want to take advantage of the increased host-to-target
transfer rates available via PCI communication.  Set up PCI
communication using the following steps:

1) Turn off power to the PC.
2) Install an appropriate target in an empty PCI bus slot in the PC host.
3) Turn on power to the PC.


Semantics
=========
You can use any of three methods to establish PCI communication with a 
target:

* To connect to a single PCI 80960DP target, use the -pci option.

* To select one of n targets, all made by the same manufacturer, use the
  -pcib option.

* To connect to a target from a unique collection of hardware devices, 
  select the target via its vendor and device ID, use the -pciv option.

Once gdb960 has opened a PCI communication channel with a target, all
target I/O transactions, including program download, are conducted via
the PCI bus.


Gdb960 PCI Communication Command Line Syntax
============================================

   gdb960 pci_comm_option [other options]... [application]


Example
=======
> gdb960 -pci myprog
(gdb960) run myarg

    Explanation:  connect to the single PCI 80960DP target in the host PC
    and download and execute myprog, passing myarg to main() as the lone
    command line argument.

> gdb960 -pcib 0 c 0 myprog
(gdb960) run myarg

    Explanation:  connect to the PCI target located at bus address 0 (bus#),
    0xc (device#), 0 (function#) and download and execute myprog, passing
    myarg to main() as the lone command line argument.


                        +++++++++++++++++++++
                        +    PCI Download   +
                        +++++++++++++++++++++

If your PC host and target support PCI communication, but application
requirements make it undesirable for the monitor to tie up the PCI bus
with I/O and various service requests (e.g., register dumps), then PCI
download can be used to augment serial communication.  Set up PCI
communication using the following steps:

1) Turn off power to the PC.
2) Install an appropriate target in an empty PCI bus slot in the PC host.
3) Additionally, connect an RS-232 serial cable between the host and target.
4) Turn on power to the PC.


Semantics
=========
To establish the PCI download channel you may use any of the three
methods previously described for opening a PCI communication channel.

Note that the serial cable is used by the host to establish the initial
connection with the target, to service interrupts and breaks, and to
transfer all non-download data between host and target.  The PCI bus is
used only to download programs to the target.


Gdb960 PCI Download Command Line Syntax
=======================================

   gdb960 -r serial_port pci_comm_option [other options]... [application]


Examples
========
> gdb960 -r com1 -pci myprog
         
    Explanation:  Debug the program myprog, downloading to the 
    PCI 80960DP target currently controlled via COM1.

> gdb960 -r com1 -pcib 0 c 0 myprog  

    Explanation: Download myprog to the PCI target controlled via COM1 and
    located at PCI bus address 0 (bus#), 0xc (device#), 0 (function#).

> gdb960 -r com2 -pciv 8086 8 myprog  

    Explanation:  Download myprog to a PCI target controlled
    via COM2 and uses vendor ID 0x8086 and device ID 0x8.

> gdb960 -r com2 -pci -parallel lpt1 myprog  

    Explanation:  Error.  More than one download channel specified.


Gdb960 Target Command Updated
=============================
The gdb960 "target" command supports all of the switches listed above and
thus, permits the user to change his/her pci download or communication
configuration once gdb960 has been invoked.


PCI HW Resources Reserved By MON960
===================================
Target                  Resource(s)[%]

Cyclone/PLX Baseboard   Mailbox registers 6 and 7 and doorbell bits 30 and
                        31 in both the local-to-PCI and PCI-to-local 
                        doorbell registers.

[%] These HW resources are reserved for exclusive use by MON960 and should
    not be modified in any way by programs executing on the target.
