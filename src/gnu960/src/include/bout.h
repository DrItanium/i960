/*
 * This file, a modified version of 'a.out.h', describes the 'b.out' format
 * produced by GNU tools modified to support the i960 processor.
 *
 * All i960 development is done in a CROSS-DEVELOPMENT environment.  I.e.,
 * object code is generated on, and executed under the direction of a symbolic
 * debugger running on, a host system.  We do not want to be subject to the
 * vagaries of which host it is or whether it supports COFF or a.out format,
 * or anything else.  We DO want to:
 *
 *	o always generate the same format object files, regardless of host.
 *
 *	o provide support for additional linker features that the normal
 *	  a.out.h header can't accommodate.
 *
 * As for byte-ordering, the following rules apply:
 *
 *	o Text and data contents (which are actually downloaded to the target)
 *	  is always in i960 (little-endian) order.
 *
 *	o Other binary numbers in the file (in the header, symbols, relocation
 *	  directives) are either all big-endian or all little-endian.  It used
 *	  to be dependent on the host on which the file was created, but we
 *	  are moving toward a tool set that accepts either order on input and
 *	  always generates little-endian output.
 *
 *	o The downloader (comm960 or gdb960) copies a b.out file to a tmp file
 *	  and converts it into a stripped little-endian COFF file before
 *	  shipping it off to the NINDY monitor in the target systems.  If you
 *	  use a different downloader and want to send a b.out file to NINDY,
 *	  you should perform the conversion explicitly -- see the objcopy
 *	  utility.

/* MEANING OF 'n_other'
 *
 * If n_other is 0, it means the symbol is an ordinary aout symbol.
 *
 * If non-zero, the 'n_other' fields indicates either a leaf procedure or
 * a system procedure, as follows:
 *
 *	1 <= n_other < N_BALNAME :
 *		The symbol is the entry point to a system procedure.
 *		'n_value' is the address of the entry, as for any other
 *		procedure.  The system procedure number (which can be used in
 *		a 'calls' instruction) is (n_other-1).  These entries come from
 *		'.sysproc' directives.
 *
 *	n_other == N_CALLNAME
 *		the symbol is the 'call' entry point to a leaf procedure.
 *		The *next* symbol in the symbol table must be the corresponding
 *		'bal' entry point to the procedure (see following).  These
 *		entries come from '.leafproc' directives in which two different
 *		symbols are specified (the first one is represented here).
 *	
 *
 *	n_other == N_BALNAME
 *		the symbol is the 'bal' entry point to a leaf procedure.
 *		These entries result from '.leafproc' directives in which only
 *		one symbol is specified, or in which the same symbol is
 *		specified twice.
 *
 * Note that an N_CALLNAME entry *must* have a corresponding N_BALNAME entry,
 * but not every N_BALNAME entry must have an N_CALLNAME entry.
